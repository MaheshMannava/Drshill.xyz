# Meme Images

This directory should contain the following image files for the memes displayed on the homepage:

1. `Image_and_frame.png` - Image for the PINP meme
2. `crap.png` - Image for the CRAP meme 
3. `cornim11.png` - Image for the KERN meme

You can create and add your own meme images with these filenames to match the references in the homepage component.
